# 🐧 Introduction to Linux

## 🔹 What is Linux?
Linux is an **open-source, Unix-like operating system** that powers servers, desktops, mobile devices, and embedded systems across the world.  
It’s known for its **stability**, **security**, and **performance** — making it the backbone of the **internet and cloud computing**.

## 🧱 Linux Architecture

| Layer | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Hardware** | Physical components like CPU, memory, and disks. |
| **Kernel** | The core part of Linux that communicates with hardware. |
| **Shell** | Interface between users and the kernel (CLI or GUI). |
| **Utilities & Apps** | User-level tools and applications. |

## 🧩 Linux Distributions

Linux comes in many “flavors” called **distributions (distros)** — each with its own package manager and default setup.

| Distribution | Package Manager | Use Case |
|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Ubuntu** | `apt` | Developer-friendly and popular |
| **Debian** | `apt` | Stable and reliable |
| **CentOS / RHEL** | `yum` / `dnf` | Enterprise servers |
| **Fedora** | `dnf` | Cutting-edge features |
| **Arch Linux** | `pacman` | Minimal, customizable |

## ⚙️ Kernel vs OS

- **Kernel** → Core of the system (handles CPU, memory, processes)
- **Operating System** → Kernel + user tools + libraries

## 💡 Why Developers Use Linux

- It’s the **default environment for servers & DevOps**.
- Supports tools like **Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins**.
- Ideal for backend languages like **Java, Python, Go, C++**.
- Better control, scripting, and automation.
